## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
Code submitted must be of high quality, clean, and readable. It should follow established coding standards and best practices.

The solution should prioritize the re-use of existing hardware components to minimize waste and cost.

### VI. Simplicity
Solutions should be simple and straightforward. Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity (YAGNI).
